    "name": "Lamborghini Aventador",
    "price": 1000,
    "description": "The Lamborghini Aventador is a mid-engine sports car produced by the Italian automotive manufacturer Lamborghini. In keeping with Lamborghini tradition, the Aventador is named after a fighting bull. Aventador (pronounced [aβentaˈðoɾ]) earned the Trofeo de la Peña La Madroñera for its courage in the arena in Zaragoza, Spain, in 1993. Production of the Aventador was planned to be limited to 4,000 vehicles; however, in 2016, it achieved the 5,000 unit milestone. The molds used to make the carbon-fibre monocoque are expected to last 500 molds each and only 8 have been made. The car's shape borrows heavily from Lamborghini's limited-edition Reventón and their Estoque concept car. The Aventador was designed by Filippo Perini, Lamborghini's head of design, replacing the then ten-year-old Murciélago as Lamborghini's flagship model."
